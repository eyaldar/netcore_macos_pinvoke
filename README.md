# netcore_macos_pinvoke
A running example of using pinvoke operations in macos on .NET Core 3.1 without Xamarin.Mac

This example include usages of strings, boolean and int types
As well as:
- runningApplications
- NSRunningApplication.isActive
- NSRunningApplication.localizedName

There are probably better ways to do it, still learning.
